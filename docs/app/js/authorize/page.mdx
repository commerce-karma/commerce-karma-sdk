# `authorize()`

Authorizes a connection to Commerce Karma by getting the api key from the url query params and saving it to cookies. For obtaining the api key see [authorizing](/getting-started/authorize). For authorizing with React you can also use the [`<Connect />`](/react/connect) component.

## Usage

Simply call the authorize function:

```ts
import { authorize } from "commerce-karma-sdk";

const apiKey = authorize();
```

You should call authorize only once. It should be called as soon as a connection is approved in the Commerce Karma UI.

If you want the connection to persist across browser you will need to sync this cookie across browser by storing your database.
