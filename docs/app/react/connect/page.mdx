# `<Connect />`

A simple unstyled pre-built connect button for clientside React. The component works out of the box saving a Commerce Karma API into cookies. Syncing the cookie across browser needs to be done by the host application.

## Basic usage

```tsx
import { Connect } from "commerce-karma-sdk";

...

return <Connect />
```

The following will be rendered:

![Connect button](/connect-button.png)

## The component has 2 states

- **Disconnected** - The button displays text prompting the user to connect. On click the user will be redirected to Commerce Karma.
- **Connected** - After the connection is complete the button is disabled and displays a connected message.

## Customizing the component

In addition to being able to pass all HTML button props you call also render a custom DOM via the `customJSX`.

```tsx
<Connect customJSX={(props) => <a {...props}>Your custom jsx</a>} />
```

As seen in the above example you must spread the props in your JSX code.
